# Sum square difference
# Problem 6
#
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
# first ten natural numbers and the square of the
# sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the
# first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
